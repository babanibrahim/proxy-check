# proxy-check
A proxy server is an intermediary server that acts as a gateway between a user and the internet. It can be used to hide the user's real IP address, to access content that may be restricted in their location, or to improve internet speed by caching frequently accessed web pages.

However, not all proxy servers are reliable, and some may be slow, unresponsive, or even malicious. To ensure that a proxy server is working properly before using it, you can use a tool made by Python to check if a proxy list is working or not.

This tool would typically work by attempting to establish a connection to a website or server through each proxy server in the list. If the connection is successful, the proxy is considered to be working. If the connection fails or times out, the proxy is marked as not working.

By using this tool, you can ensure that you only use reliable and responsive proxy servers, which can help improve your internet experience and protect your privacy online.
